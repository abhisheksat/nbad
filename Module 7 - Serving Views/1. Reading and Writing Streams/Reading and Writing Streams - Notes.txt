#1. Streams and Buffers:

Buffers:
- Temporary storage spot for a chunk of data that is being transferred
from one place to another
- The buffer is filled with data, then passed along
- Transfer small chunks of data at a time

Streams:
- Stream of data that flows over time from one place to another
- The data is divided into sizeable chunks, placed in buffer
  and once the buffer is full, that chunk is sent to the client

We can start consuming the data even before the entire thing has arrived
The processing / consumption can start right away when the first chunk is
received

#2. Streams in Node.js

- Can create streams in Node.jsto transfer data
- Increase performance

Readable Streams

Streams

* Writeable streams : allow node js to write data to a stream
* Readable streams : allow node js to read data from a stream
* Duplex : can read and write data to a stream
