Handling Post Requests

- POST is a HTTP request method
- We ask the server to accept / store some data which is enclosed in the body
  of the request
- We normally use POST request while submitting forms
- Does not use url parameters, but has the data to be submitted in request body

- We need body-parser module to handle the incoming request body
Since we are using it with express, they call it Express route-specific in the following documentation
for body-parser
